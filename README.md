Develop an online-shop.

A system, which allows customers to browse catalogue, choose goods and purchase it.

### Key features
- **maintaining categories and goods**

    Administrator should have an ability to create and maintain categories and goods items. 
- **browse and search goods**

    Customer should have an ability to browse catalogue within categories or find goods he interested in with a search.
    Search can be filtered by price either category.

- **cart**

    Registered users put goods in cart for subsequent purchase. They can correct goods amount after that or delete items they don't need anymore - and go to order checkout.

- **stocks track**

    System has to keep track of goods stock and not allow to sell same units to different users.

    System allows to accept payments from customers.

- **order processing, history**

    System should save order history and keep track of its processing status.
